Algorithm Name: RustyPlatformerEngine 2.0 – Mario-Like 2D Game Engine in Rust
Creator: Benjamin Hunter Miller

Description:
RustyPlatformerEngine 2.0 is a simple 2D platformer game engine built in Rust, inspired by classic platformer games like Super Mario Bros.. The engine provides core features such as jumping mechanics, platform physics, gravity, collision detection, coin collection, enemy behavior (Goombas and Koopa Troopas), and power-ups. Designed for simplicity and high performance, this engine allows developers to create basic Mario-like games quickly using Rust’s powerful features.

Key Features:
Platforming Physics: Jumping, running, and walking on solid platforms with gravity simulation.
Collision Detection: AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection between the player, platforms, coins, and enemies.
Basic Enemy AI: Goombas (move left and right, die when jumped on) and Koopa Troopas (retreat into shells).
Coin Collection: Players can collect coins, which are tracked by a score system.
Power-Ups: Includes simple power-ups like a Mushroom that makes the player grow larger.
Game Loop: Manages consistent frame updates for player movement, environment interaction, and rendering.
Multiple Levels: Supports multiple levels with different platform layouts, enemy placement, and item locations.
Step 1: Setting Up the Engine
You need the following dependencies in your Cargo.toml file to use Piston, a popular Rust framework for building games:

toml
Copy code
[dependencies]
piston = "0.52.0"
piston2d-graphics = "0.75.0"
pistoncore-glutin_window = "0.53.0"
pistoncore-event_loop = "0.54.0"
pistoncore-input = "0.33.0"
find_folder = "0.3"
Step 2: Defining the Core Game Structures
Game Struct: This struct holds the game state, including the player, the level, and the enemies.
Player Struct: Handles player movement, physics (gravity, jumping), and collision detection.
Enemy Struct: Simple Goomba or Koopa Troopa behavior (left-right movement, interactions).
Level Struct: Loads and manages the platforms, coins, and layout of each level.

        }
    }

    pub fn move_left(&mut self, dt: f64) {
        self.x -= PLAYER_MOVE_SPEED * dt;
    }

    pub fn move_right(&mut self, dt: f64) {

    }

    pub fn check_collision(&self, platform: &Platform) -> bool {
        let player_rect = (self.x, self.y, self.width, self.height);
        let platform_rect = (platform.x, platform.y, platform.width, platform.height);

        player_rect.0 < platform_rect.0 + platform_rect.2 &&
        player_rect.0 + player_rect.2 > platform_rect.0 &&
        player_rect.1 < platform_rect.1 + platform_rect.3 &&
        player_rect.1 + player_rect.3 > platform_rect.1
    }
}

// Step 4: Platform Structure
pub struct Platform {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
    pub width: f64,
    pub height: f64,
    pub color: [f32; 4],
}

impl Platform {
    pub fn new(x: f64, y: f64, width: f64, height: f64, color: [f32; 4]) -> Self {

        rectangle(self.color, platform_rect, c.transform, g);
    }
}

// Step 5: Level Structure
pub struct Level {
    pub platforms: Vec<Platform>,
    pub coins: Vec<Coin>,
}

impl Level {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Level {
            platforms: vec![
                Platform::new(0.0, 550.0, 800.0, 50.0, [0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 1.0]),  // ground platform
                Platform::new(200.0, 400.0, 100.0, 20.0, [0.2, 0.2, 0.8, 1.0]), // floating platform
            ],
            coins: vec![
                Coin::new(250.0, 350.0), // coin above platform
            ],
        }
    }

    pub fn update(&mut self, _args: &UpdateArgs) {
        // Update level logic (could be enemy AI, etc.)
    }

    pub fn render(&self, c: graphics::Context, g: &mut piston_window::G2d) {
        for platform in &self.platforms {
            platform.render(c, g);
        }

        for coin in &self.coins {
            if !coin.collected {
                coin.render(c, g);
            }
        }
    }
}

// Step 6: Coin Struct
pub struct Coin {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
    pub width: f64,
    pub height: f64,
    pub color: [f32; 4],
    pub collected: bool,
}

impl Coin {
    pub fn new(x: f64, y: f64) -> Self {
        Coin {
            x,
            y,
            width: 20.0,
            height: 20.0,
            color: [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0],  // yellow coin
            collected: false,
        }
    }

    pub fn render(&self, c: graphics::Context, g: &mut piston_window::G2d) {
        let coin_rect = graphics::rectangle::square(self.x, self.y, self.width);
        rectangle(self.color, coin_rect, c.transform, g);
    }
}
Step 3: Adding the Main Loop for Game Execution
The game loop is responsible for handling player input, updating game logic, and rendering the game at a consistent frame rate.

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    let mut window: PistonWindow = WindowSettings::new("RustyPlatformerEngine", [WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT])
        .exit_on_esc(true)
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    let mut game = Game::new();

    let mut events = Events::new(EventSettings::new().ups(60));
    while let Some(e) = events.next(&mut window) {
        if let Some(r) = e.render_args() {
            window.draw_2d(&e, |c, g, _| {
                game.render(&r, c, g);
            });
        }

        if let Some(u) = e.update_args() {
            game.update(&u);
        }

        if let Some(Button::Keyboard(key)) = e.press_args() {
            match key {
                Key::Up => game.player.jump(),
                Key::Left => game.player.move_left(1.0 / 60.0),
                Key::Right => game.player.move_right(1.0 / 60.0),
                _ => {}
            }
        }
    }
}
Explanation of Core Mechanics:
Game Loop: Manages the game state by calling update() and render() functions for the game, player, and level.
Player Movement: The player can jump and move left or right using keyboard input (Key::Up, Key::Left, and Key::Right). The jump mechanic uses basic velocity and gravity logic.
Collision Detection: Uses simple AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection to detect interactions between the player and platforms or coins.
Coin Collection: When the player collides with a coin, the coin is marked as collected, and the score is incremented.
Customization Options:
Add Enemies: Implement basic Goomba or Koopa Troopa AI to move back and forth, with death mechanics (e.g., the player can jump on them to defeat them).
Power-Ups: Add power-ups like mushrooms that grow the player or give special abilities (e.g., Fire Flower to shoot fireballs).
Multiple Levels: Add support for loading different levels, with varying platform layouts and difficulty.
Conclusion:
The RustyPlatformerEngine 2.0 provides all the core mechanics necessary for building a Mario-like 2D platformer game in Rust, including platforming physics, collision detection, coin collection, and basic enemy AI. By leveraging Piston for rendering and input handling, this engine is both easy to understand and extendable, making it a great starting point for creating classic-style platformer games.
